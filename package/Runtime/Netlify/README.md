# Deploying to Netlify

Just add the `DeployToNetlify` component to your scene and follow the instructions. You can create new projects with the click of a button or deploy to existing projects.

You need a Netlify account in opposition to glitch, where you can have temporary projects without one. 

Netlify has a [free plan](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) for personal projects.
