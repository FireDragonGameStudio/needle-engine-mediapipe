Hotspots are a handy way to display extra information and highlight important parts of your product. It can improve the user experience by offering more information in a clear and organized way.

The logic is structured into 3 components.

### Hotspot Manager
Gets everything started and manages settings like `"Force single active"` which prevents multiple hotspots to be opened at the same time.

### Hotspot Behaviour
The Hotspot Behaviour takes care of how a hotspot looks and behaves with settings like fading and Z offset. You can find that on the `"HotspotTemplate"` game object. 

### Hotspot
Here is where we define where it appears, what it says, and the angles users can see it from. You can see a preview of the view angle. Note that you have to enable Gizmos.
