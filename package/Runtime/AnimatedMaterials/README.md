# Animated Properties

You can animate the majority of the properties of your components very much like animating them in Blender.

This sample showcases how to animate:

 - Material properties such as color or roughness
 - Blends shapes / morph targets
 - Object position, rotation and scale
    - Even for bones of a skinned / skeletal mesh
 - Spotlight parameters

 Open the Animation tab (right click any tab -> `Add tab / Animation`)
 and then select an object that you are interested in. It should automatically open an animation that animates that object.

 The default view is a dope sheet, but you can also switch to curves.
